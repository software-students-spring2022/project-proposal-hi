# Title: Job/Internship Manager

# What and why?
The Job/Internship Manager keep tracks of all the companies that someone has applied to. The user no longer has to manually keep track of their application in Excel or Google Sheets since this manager will automate this process. Applying to jobs/internships can be a repetitive process. Since machines execute repetitive processes much better than humans, this manager can auto-apply to companies with an attached resume/CV. This saves the user time and allows them to go back to leetcoding. 

# For whom?
This software is intended for anyone applying to a job/internship. 

# How?
The programmer can teach the manager the steps necessary to submit a job application, and then the manager will be able to execute this task on its own. The manager also needs to support file I/O to store the resume/CV. Lastly, the manager needs a database to store all submitted applications in an organized manner. The manager can add a new row to the database for every application submission that includes the company name, position/role, date applied, etc. 

# Scope
This project is definitely suitable for a group of 4-6 people. The programmers need to support file I/O, button clicks (for submitting an application), and automatically adding records into a database. These are all features that are not too simple or too difficult to implement. File I/O might be a relatively familiar concept, while making a program to click buttons and add entires into a database might be new concepts.
